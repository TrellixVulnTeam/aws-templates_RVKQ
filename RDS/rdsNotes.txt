1. Always use custom endpoints(readers, writers, region etc) & attach to DB endpoint DNS address so that you do 
failover and node change without changing the primary URL apps use to access the DB
2. Always use Systems Manager Parameter Store & Secrets Manager for DB DNS address, user & pw. Environment variables
or worse - embedded 
3. Always enable both password & IAM authentication with cross referencing security groups (i.e. for EC2 & DB) 
cluster and strict IAM policies & NACLs
4. Usually a very bad idea to have the DBs in the same subnets with other stuff like EC2, ECS, Lamda etc
5. Needless to say but had to say, never launch a database in a public subnet =)
