# Purpose
# This code example demonstrates how to upload an object to a bucket in
# Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and how to associate specified
# metadata with the uploaded object.

# snippet-start:[s3.ruby.s3-ruby-example-upload-item-with-metadata]

require 'aws-sdk-s3'

# Prerequisites:
#
# - An S3 bucket.
# - An object to upload to the bucket.
#
# @param s3_client [Aws::S3::Client] An initialized S3 client.
# @param bucket_name [String] The name of the bucket.
# @param object_key [String] The name of the object.
# @param metadata [Hash] Metadata to associate with the uploaded object.
# @return [Boolean] true if the object was uploaded; otherwise, false.
# @example
#   exit 1 unless object_uploaded?(
#     Aws::S3::Client.new(region: 'us-west-2'),
#     'doc-example-bucket',
#     'my-file.txt'
#   )
