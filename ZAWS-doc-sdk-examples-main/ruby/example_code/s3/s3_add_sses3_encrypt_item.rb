# Purpose
# This code example demonstrates how to add an encrypted object to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
# bucket. The encryption is performed on the server by using the AWS managed customer master key (CMK).

# snippet-start:[s3.ruby.s3_add_sses3_encrypt_item]

require 'aws-sdk-s3'

# Prerequisites:
#
# - An Amazon S3 bucket.
#
# @param s3_client [Aws::S3::Client] An initialized Amazon S3 client.
# @param bucket_name [String] The name of the bucket.
# @param object_key [String] The name to assign to the uploaded object.
# @param content_to_encrypt [String] The content to be encrypted.
# @return [Boolean] true if the encrypted object was successfully uploaded;
#   otherwise, false.
# @example
#   exit 1 unless kms_sse_encrypted_object_uploaded?(
#     Aws::S3::Client.new(region: 'us-west-2'),
#     'doc-example-bucket',
#     'my-file.txt',
#     'This is the content of my-file.txt.'
#   )
